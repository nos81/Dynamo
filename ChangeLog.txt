1.4.0       2016-07-14
              + ChangeLog.txt
              + Ensemble optimization.
              * dynamo/compute_error can return errors and gradients of individual ensemble members.
              * docs: User manual expanded and updated.
              * Stats system can handle several optimization runs. Interrupted runs can be continued automatically.
              * dynamo/easy_control replaced with dynamo/set_controls.
              * Gradient system simplified. Added gradients using a truncated Taylor series
                with scaling and squaring, and the auxiliary matrix technique.
              + dynamo/gradient_dPdu
              + utils/dPdu_series, utils/dPdu_eig, utils/dPdu_auxmatrix
              - dynamo/error_real
              - dynamo/gradient_full
              - dynamo/gradient_g
              - dynamo/gradient_g_mixed_exact
              - dynamo/gradient_tr
              * Implemented various numerics-related recommendations from Nocedal-Wright.
              + utils/bfgs: Native implementation of the BFGS optimization algorithm.
              + utils/apply_options: MATLAB-style options processing.
              + dynamo/plot_pop, dynamo/plot_eig, dynamo/plot_stats: New plotting functions.
              + dynamo/shake: Randomly perturbs the control sequence, can be used to get out of local optima.
              + dynamo/split: Refines the control sequence by splitting given bins into several.
              + test: Unit tests for DYNAMO.
              + test_rand_problem: Generates random optimization problems for testing/benchmarking purposes.
              + test_benchmark: Measures the walltime required to compute different errors and gradients.
              + examples/demo_coop_gates
              + examples/demo_tau
              + examples/demo_tasks
              + examples/demo_ensemble
              - examples/demo_abstract
              b Always returns the reason why the optimization ended.
              b dynamo/gradient_setup: gradient_g_mixed_exact provided with wrong *_needed_now.
              b dynamo/gradient_g_mixed_exact: gradient with respect to tau was wrong.
              b qsystem.B_is_Hamiltonian was not set up properly, resulting in a spurious warning.


1.4.1       in progress
              * init: added the examples directory to the path
              * New task 'closed gate subspace' for the cases where you only care about what happens in a specific subspace.
              * Optimizing co-operative gates/state transfers in open and closed systems using the projector technique.
              * utils/control_ops:  Normalization changed for the Liouvillians (now lowest eigenvalue == -1)
              + dynamo/frobenius_error
              + dynamo/evaluate_X
              + control_seq/transform
              + cache/combined_propagator
