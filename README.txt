DYNAMO - Quantum Dynamic Optimization Package

Version 1.4.0
Released 2016-07-14


Introduction
============

DYNAMO is a flexible framework for solving numerical optimal control
problems for quantum systems. It requires MATLAB R2011a or newer
(matlab.mixin.Copyable).

The latest development version can be downloaded from our Git
repository at https://github.com/smite/Dynamo
The user manual can be found in docs/dynamo_manual.tex, together with
the bibliography.

Getting started
===============

Initialize the package by running init.m

The best way to learn how to use DYNAMO is to review the demos in the
examples/ directory.


Design
======

The design is modularized and easily extendable.

DYNAMO attempts to minimize calculations by way of delayed calculations.
Whenever a control field is modified, DYNAMO marks that value as changed,
and the mathematical objects that depend on it (single-slice exponents, start-to-t and
t-to-end propagators etc.) as stale. Only when a specific stale object is needed
(such as propagators when computing the error), are the calculations performed.
At this point DYNAMO attempts to perform the minimal number of matrix exponentiations and
multiplications to arrive at the desired result.

See cache.m for the nitty-gritty details.
